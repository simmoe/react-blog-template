This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React blog template
This project demonstrates a very basic blog build with ReactJS. 
* Template: create-react-app
* Backend: Google Firebase.firestore
* Routing: Reach Router
* Authentication: Google (redirect) - only one specific person can update, delete and create projects

Of course you can't edit, create or update projects in the demo. But if you like the project, go ahead and fork it. Then you  can exchange the firebase keys in the code and create your own blog from there - tutorial below.

## Step-by-step tutorial

  install reach-router
  install firebase
